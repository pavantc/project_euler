The formula for sum of squares upto n is given by (n)*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6
The formula for sum of natural numbers upto n is given by (n)*(n+1)/2

Difference of sum of squares and square of sum is :

   SQ[n*(n+1)/2] - (n)*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6
 = n^2*(n+1)^2/4 - (n)*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6
 = (n)*(n+1)/2 * [ (n)(n+1)/2 - (2n+1)/3 ]

 For n = 100,
 = 100*(101)/2 * [ (100)*(101)/2 - 201/3]
 = 50*101 * [ 50*101 - 67 ]
 = 5050 * [ 5050 - 67 ]
 = 5050 * 4983
 = 25164150
